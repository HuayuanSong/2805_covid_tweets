## Introduction
In early 2020, after seeing the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus across borders and continents, countries across the globe went into hard lockdown to mitigate the contagion. The initial COVID response from the UK government led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been labeled as inadequate [1] and is a contrast to the early Canadian response, which has received praise for its strong performance and persistence, resulting in fewer deaths per capita [2]. With reduced mobility and physical connections, people turned to their mobile devices in order to connect virtually [3]. While Facebook is the dominant social medium for most of the world [4], Twitter has been characterised as a unique discussion hub with immense influence on media and politics [5][6][7]. Its diverse set of users ranges from ordinary citizens to celebrities and official government accounts [8]. This paper examines the usage of Twitter in Canada and the UK during the initial COVID wave in 2020 using methods from network science and natural language processing (NLP). We build social network graphs of users that mention each other in their tweets and identify communities using the Louvain algorithm. We carry out an explorative analysis with the goal of understanding the public sentiment and shedding light on the following open questions: *What were the most important discussion themes in the tweets?* *Who were the most central users?*
